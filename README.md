# OpenBack Xamarin Sample App

This application is a simple project highlighting the integration of the OpenBack library into a Xamarin Forms application. It shows how to set custom trigger values using the OpenBack SDK. It also comes with a ready made OpenBack app code, which has already been setup with some simple campaigns reacting to the trigger values.

> For the full Xamarin integration guide, check out the [OpenBack Documentation](https://docs.openback.com/plugins/xamarin).

## How the sample app was setup

A basic Xamarin Forms project was created in Visual Studio 2019 using the `Blank Forms App` and .NET standard. 

OpenBack was added from NuGet as well as Xamarin.Firebase.Messaging for the Android application.

Both iOS and Android share the same code.
